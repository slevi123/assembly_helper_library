_Helper scripts for using assembly (created by an UBB info student)_


## Quick scripts
 IMPORTANT:
* After cloning add the root folder to the path!

* Change the folder path in `asm_compiler.bat` to your path:

```bat
:: asm_compiler.bat
...
set common_files=D:...\helper_progs\common_files
...
```

Debugger:

1. Install [SASM](https://github.com/Dman95/SASM)!

2. To convert from SASM syntax to school nasm syntax, use `asm_transform school|sasm file.asm`

* _root directory needs to be added to the path!_
